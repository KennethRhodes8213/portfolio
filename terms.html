<h3>Terms of Agreement</h3>
By hiring me you agree to allow me the following:<br>
	<ul>
		<li> Ability to use the work I do for the employer in my portfolio.</li>
		<li> Place my name, and a link to my website on any work I do, reasonably, if I wish. <sup>(1)</sup></li>
		<li> Create invoices or paystubs requiring the employer's signature if not already supplied.</li>
	</ul>
	
<sup>(1)</sup>: Reasonably means I will not place it wherever you, as the employer, don't like. (E.g I will not place it on the front of a web page if you wish, but I will place a comment somewhere in the code at the bottom of the document.)
